🛡️ AI-Powered Fake News Detection System**</u>

    A Project Developed Under AICTE Internship Program

📝**Project Overview**

    This project is an AI-driven solution developed during my AI/ML Internship (AICTE) to identify and mitigate the spread of misinformation . By leveraging            Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system classifies news articles as "Real" or "Fake" with high precision .

📂 How to Set Up Your Project Folder:

🔗To ensure your project runs without errors, organize your files as follows:

    1.Create a new folder (eg: FAKE_NEWS_PROJECT).


    2.Place all the following files inside that folder:

      app.py (Your Main Website Code.) 
  
      model.pkl (Trained Machine Learning model)
  
      vectorizer.pkl (Saved TF-IDF vectorizer) 
  
      requirements.txt (List of libraries to install) 
  
      Fake_News_Detection.ipynb (Original research/training notebook) 
  

🛠️ Technical Implementation (Internship Workflow)

    The system operates through a structured professional pipeline learned during the internship:

       Step 1: Data Preprocessing: Cleaning noise and special characters from the raw dataset .

       Step 2: Feature Engineering: Using Stemming to reduce words to their root forms for better analysis .

       Step 3: Vectorization: Converting text into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization .

       Step 4: Classification: Implementing a Logistic Regression algorithm for efficient binary prediction .


💻 Installation & Usage

    Follow these steps to run the project on your localhost:


    1. Install Required Libraries
   
       pip install -r requirements.txt

    2. Launch the Web App

       streamlit run app.py
   
📊 Performance & Results

    Algorithm: Logistic Regression 

    Dataset: Trained on authenticated news corpora 

    Deployment: Streamlit-based interactive web dashboard
